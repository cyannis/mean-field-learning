# mean-field-learning

We want to find the following latent binary variables that are used to generate a bunch of 4x4 images.

The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is intractable because the latent variables are binary.
Hence, we use the variational approximation of the model to derive a new algorithm called Mean-Field Learning.
